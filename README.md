# SOPROTIVLENIE (SOPROT)
An in-dev guerilla warfare sim for Arma 3 which tries to combine the best of Vindicta and the best of Overthrow.

# NOTE
I'm fairly new to SQF, so I try to learn from existing source code (ie Vindicta & Overthrow), so some of the code may look similar as I recreated it / grabbed it as I think it's the best way to solve the problem I'm trying to solve.

# Features
Currently only features basic base functionality, as well as ambient vehicles and gendarmerie spawns. Nothing much as of yet.

# Using
- OOP-Light by Sparker95
- SQFLint
